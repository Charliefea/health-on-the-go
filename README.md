## Problem
 In areas without mobile data, how can health care professionals access patient data

## Solution

* A patient record system which authorised users (Health Care Workers) could query using SMS

## Our MVP

* A Rails Application that medical staff can sign into, input patient information and input medical information
* The Doctor or Health Care worker can also query this data through SMS (using Twilio) and receive an update

## Further Features
* Ability to digitise current records
* Ability to add to patient records through sms

##Why should this idea win?

**Better Outcomes for Patients** - Having access to patient history and patient test results in real time give Health Care professionals a better understands

**Better Understanding of Health Care trends** - With more effective data collection more in depth analysis about community health and trends can be done.

**Fundability**
* The market for this is in communities which have mobile signal but do not have access to mobile internet
* Patient data can be used by anonymised and used for research projects
* Could also be funded through community health projects
* It could be a sustainable business model as it could be provided as SaaS with a monthly fee

**Execution**
* We focused on building an MVP which incorporates some of the most important features including being able to store patient data, querying the data.

**UI/UX**
* We spoke to a doctor in Nigeria who highlighted the difficulties he has with treating patients in rural areas

**Originality**
* How original, creative or unique is this idea?

**Scalability**
* While we would focus on one small community to test out our concept.

**Impact**
* It will make an impact through improving healthcare in rural areas.
